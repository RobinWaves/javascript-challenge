## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Background: The extra terrestrial menace has come to Earth and ALIENS-R-REAL has collected all of the eye-witness reports to prove it!  This challenge puts this information online for the world to see!  

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Created a basic HTML web page 

* Using the UFO dataset provided, a table was appended to the web page and then new rows of data for each UFO sighting we added.  Columns for date, city, state, country, shape and comments were included.

* Users can filter the sightings by the date column.  JavaScript listens for events and searches the date column to match user input.

* UFO-Level-1 
  - index.html - main page
  - static directory
    * css - style.css
    * images - images used for html page
    * js - data source and javascript code


### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* All of Level 1 criteria

* Using multiple select dropdowns, the user can set multiple filters and search the UFO sightings based on table columns: date, city, state, country and shape.

* UFO-Level-2 
  - index.html - main page
  - static directory
    * css - style.css
    * images - images used for html page
    * js - data source and javascript code

### Usage: 
Download all directories and files on your local machine.  Run index.html in either UF0 Level 1 or Level 2 directories for a different search experience.
